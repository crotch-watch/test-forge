# Automated Testing with JavaScript

This covers automated unit and integration testing using JavaScript. It provides a practical, hands-on approach, focusing on writing tests and integrating them into real-world projects.

## Key Concepts Learned

- **Unit & Integration Testing**: Writing tests for both simple and complex code, understanding the importance of each.
- **Vitest**: Using Vitest, a modern test runner and assertion library (compatible with Jest). The knowledge transfers to other setups like Jest.
- **Mocking & Spies**: Handling common testing challenges like mocking and working with spies.
- **Project Agnostic**: Testing principles applicable to any JavaScript project, including backend Node.js apps and frontend frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular.

## Detailed Learnings

1. **Automated Testing Fundamentals**
   - Understanding what automated testing is and its importance.
   - Differentiating between unit testing and integration testing.

2. **Tools & Setup**
   - Familiarity with the tools and libraries for automated testing.

3. **Writing Tests**
   - Writing unit tests and testing both synchronous and asynchronous code.
   - Formulating different types of assertions and expectations.

4. **Testing Strategies**
   - Following best patterns for clean, effective tests.
   - Handling side effects with spies and mocks.

5. **Real-world Applications**
   - Testing real-world projects across frontend and backend.

## Takeaways
